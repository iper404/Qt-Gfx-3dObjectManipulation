This project was done in C++ with Qt Creator and OpenGL Shader Language.

GUI-Interface based program which displays an array of triangles through a fixed camera view. It allows the user to specify triangles by clicking on the 3D viewport with the mouse to determine successive vertices. Users can translate the current list of triangles in the X, Y, or Z direction via mouse clicks.
